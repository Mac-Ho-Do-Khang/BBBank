# README: Network Design and Simulation Project

## Overview

This project, "Network Design and Simulation for a Critical Large Company," was completed independently as part of the Computer Networks course (CO3094). The objective was to design, simulate, and evaluate a computer network for a large company using Cisco Packet Tracer (CPT). The design includes a Headquarters in Ho Chi Minh City and two branch offices in Da Nang and Ha Noi.

### Disclaimer

This project is for learning purposes only and was completed solely by me. The included files demonstrate the application of networking principles and practical use of Cisco Packet Tracer.
